Currently, the Hackspace's physical space is primarily located in unit G11 in [[http://www.bvstudios.co.uk|BV Studios]]. Most of the rest of the units in the building are occupied by artists of different types.

====== Rent payments ======

We actually rent 4 separate subdivisions of G11:
  * The main space near the street door up to the line in the concrete floor - 350.5 sq.ft., rent £155.39/month
  * The smaller space next to it (historically known as "the architects' space") - 165.5 sq.ft. plus 28sq.ft. communal space, rent £73.31/month. A 12-month contract starting on 1 June 2012 was signed in September 2012.
  * The space to the left of the architects' space as you come in through the street door ("Jenny's space", 195sq.ft.) and the space at the far end of G11 with the sink in it ("Poppy's space", 153.3sq.ft.). Taking on these two spaces also added another 84 sq.ft. of communal space. Total rent for these two is £181.34. Renting these spaces was agreed with Penny 20/3/2013 and we actually moved in 14/4/2013.

There is now only one other tenant in G11, Gareth.

We also have some space in unit G10 across the corridor from G11, which we use for messy tools (a bandsaw and a wood lathe currently). On 30/11/2012 we took on a small slice (approx 4x2m) as a sublet from the unit renter, Matt Cox, for £28/month or £336/year. On 30/4/2013 Matt moved out and we took on the whole of the space, for a sum of £57/month or £684/year. Electricity for this space costs £8/month.

The total rent we pay to BV Studios is therefore currently £467/month or £5604/year.

On 22 March 2014 we decided to take on Gareth's space in G11 (for which he has given 2 months' notice), costing £45/month, and Liam's space in G10, costing £52/month.

The space in G11 is rented out for £5 per sq ft per year. There is also a charge of £3/month for wifi (per space?) included in the amounts above.

Contracts notwithstanding, space in the building is in high demand so we believe we should be able to move out at an arbitrary time without too much trouble.
