Ginjaian is 3D-printing parts for a small lathe. Alaric's offered to pay him for plastic to finish it off so he can build it as it looks fun. This has started to grow into a group project to have a small lathe in the space.

Matthew Venn has a Proper Metal Lathe that can be borrowed for a small fee, but there's still a benefit to this little one:

  * It'll be fine for simple tasks.
  * If we break it, we can print new parts (let's be honest, it's the plastic bits that will break) rather than having a huge repair bill.
  * It'll be owned by the group so we can extend it crazily until it's CNC controlled, sentient, and able to reproduce itself.
  * It'll be fun.

=== Contributers So Far ===

  * Ginjaian for use of his 3D printer and his time and maybe some other bits (was a threaded rod or two mentioned?)
  * Alaric has pledged Â£30 for the plastic, and some time to put it together and play with it, and will obtain some parts as required.
