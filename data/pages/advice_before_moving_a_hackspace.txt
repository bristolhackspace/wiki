From Jon at leeds hackspace

  * Stay on top of all the boring bureaucratic stuff. 
  * Ensure whatever you go for you can afford (if you have a firm commitment to membership and some savings that will cover you for 12 months then you're you should be ok).
  * Don't go for somewhere out of the way - a nice central easily accessible space will pay dividends in new members. 
  * If you can get somewhere small with current membership and there's room to expand if membership explodes then that will be a major plus - moving SUCKS. 


From Paul at leeds hackspace

  * Make sure anyone you need to communicate with had your new address. 
  * Remember to cancel the phone/electricty/milk, etc. Otherwise six months later you discover thet you're saddled with a large unpaid bill for a service you haven't been using, and didn't know about because the bills were sent to someone who no longer comes to the hackspace. 
  * Many of our problems may have been exacerbated because we didn't just move spaces, we pretty much rebuilt the whole organisation. 

From Russ at London hackspace
 
  * London managed to get a 300% bump in membership revenue in 4 months which covered significant rent increase
  * What you need to try and fathom how many more potential members there  might be, and if there are, why they haven't already joined.
  * Try and work out how to spread the word further than the current community. Have a big moving-in party.
