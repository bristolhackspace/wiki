The lathe belongs to Anton, is in G10, and is free for hackspace members to use. Ask Anton or Matt for help if you are unsure how to use it.

The headstock has 1" x 8 tpi thread for a chuck (we don't have a chuck at the moment). Both headstock and tailstock are MT 2. 

Please follow sensible safety rules:

  * wear eye protection
  * don't wear long dangly things (clothes, hair, jewellery)
  * make sure workpiece is secure and can rotate freely before switching on
  * if you use hands on the rotating workpiece (sanding or polishing), do so on the side of the work away from the toolrest, to avoid getting fingers trapped.
