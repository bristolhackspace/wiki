== Cards vs Fobs ==
The building management want our fobs back in return for cards. We don't know if the fobs will stop working.

== Current keys available == 

We have 3 keys and fobs atm.

== List of current key holders ==

  * If you want a key add your name to the list, pay the deposit and email the list. The deposit is to be paid to the usual account, and is £30. £20 of the deposit is returnable.
  * If you have a key/fob and haven't yet paid your deposit, please pay.
  * If you have a key/fob and aren't on the list please add yourself.
