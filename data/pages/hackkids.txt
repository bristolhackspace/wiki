[[http://hackkids.org/|HackKids]] is a place for kids of all ages to come and have fun with science and technology in a safe and informal environment.  We meet on the last Sunday of the month at 14:00 until 16:00 and it's all free.

Although we welcome kids of any age, we do ask that parents remain with primary age kids and below.
