Dear participant,

thanks again for joining us!

To help us get started quickly, please install the arduino IDE on your computer (http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage)

We start at 10am on Saturday.

You are heading to http://www.pmstudio.co.uk/about-pervasive-media-studio.
If you have any problems getting in or finding us, please call Matt on xxxxxx

There are bike racks outside and bus stops near by. If you come by car then there are some local car parks: Millenium Car Park. the NCP and the Trenchard Street multistorey is not too long a walk, and is cheaper.

You can bring lunch with you, or there are local places to eat in or take out.

You may find it useful to have an old-fashioned notebook and pen with you to jot down notes for your own reference.

Finally, we want to spend Sunday helping you to build your own projects; so have a think about what you might like to do. Lots of inspiration here:
