It can be embedded in HTML thusly:

''<iframe src="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=cl77stok6eifnrq19p0lf24koo%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>''

If you have an event to add, get in touch with David Wyatt, who can add things directly or give you write access. To do the latter he'll need your Google account email address if you have one - if not, he can send you the password for the account set up for the Hackspace (admin at bristol.hackspace.org.uk).
