Page links in red in the table below mean we haven't written any information about this thing on the Wiki yet. If you can contribute, please do so!

Equipment pages should indicate where the thing is to be found, who to ask for induction training if it's something that could hurt the user (or that could be easily damaged), a list of inducted people who might be asked for help by new users, and any pertinent safety tips.

For extra points, specifications of the thing (what size of work it can do, etc), links to manuals/tutorials, and so on can be included for reference!

===== Hackspace layout =====

A more-or-less scale plan of the hackspace is as follows (10cm = 1m): (compiled by David W and Jon, June 2012 after acquisition of the architects' space)

The first page is just the space itself; the second page has some of the furniture, but we didn't measure how big much of it was!
