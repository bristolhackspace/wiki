== Children's Scrapstore ==
In September 2013 we purchased a year's membership to the [[ http://www.childrensscrapstore.co.uk/ | Children's Scrapstore]] (expires 17 September 2014). 

To use the Scrapstore you need to take a membership card. We have 4 cards, in the filing cabinet against the wall by the glass door, on the right hand side if you are inside the space facing the door. They're in the drawer labelled "paperwork" (the 3rd drawer down). The cards are numbered - if you borrow one, please could you sign it out (and in) on the paper signing-out sheet in the drawer with them.
