**Description:** Hackspace to purchase ten of the cheaper Chinese versions of Arduino Uno currently on the market, for Hackspace internal use. 
 Purchase charge £6.59 each from Hong Kong. These can then be kept for training purposes, or offered for sale to course attendees at £7 each (which will give the Hackspace a small profit if sold, and access to what we need for educational purposes otherwise). .
