BV Studios Open Day 2013 will be over the weekend Fri 14-Sun 16 June (Friday evening and all day Saturday and Sunday). It would be nice to show off a few projects, such as the ones discussed at the [[botlab:openmeeting_20130603 | open meeting on 3 June]].

If you're intending to bring a project, please could you add it to this list:

  * Sketchy should be there, though I won't be about to run it all weekend.

  * The Eye is available.

  * Anton & Richard should have the Slow Camera running by then.

  * Add your project here!
