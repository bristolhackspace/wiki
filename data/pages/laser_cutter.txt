A laser cutter is a computer-controlled machine that moves a powerful laser in two dimensions. As such, it can cut or engrave flat objects, quickly and accurately, to a design you produce on a computer using software such as Inkscape, CorelDraw, or your own code.

Cutting is done by slowly drawing the shape you want cut, with the laser on a high power, so it cuts all the way through. As the laser moves through the exact shape you want, nice clean cuts with smooth edges are produced.

Engraving is done by rapidly scanning the laser back and forth across the workpiece, turning it on and off as it goes to "scan" shapes in a raster pattern. As it is moving quickly, and at a lower power, it only burns away the top layer of the material, creating the engraved pattern.

The hackspace has the shared use of a laser cutter, owned by Lauren. It is in the messy space.

==== Dire warning ====

DO NOT USE THE LASER CUTTER UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN INDUCTED IN ITS USE AND SIGNED THE USAGE AGREEMENT. YOU MAY DAMAGE IT OR YOURSELF. {{:lasercutter:laser_cutter_user_agreement.pdf|Reference copy of user agreement}}

Inductions cost £30 (or £10 if you are already an experienced laser cutter user and just need to know the details of this laser), and usage is charged at £15 per hour.

==== Rules for using the Laser Cutter ====

During the induction, the procedure for safe usage of the laser cutter will be explained to you.

{{:lasercutter:laser_cutter_rules.pdf|Laser Cutter Rules}}

A copy of the checklist will soon be attached to the laser cutter for on-site reference.

==== Capabilities of the laser cutter ====

Bed size (largest sheet of material it can work on): 812mm x 508mm

Suitable materials for cutting: 

  * Laser-safe plywood, 
  * Acrylic (aka Perspex), 
  * Paper
  * Leather

No other materials are to be used, as they may produce toxic and/or damaging fumes. (Lauren has suggested that other laser-safe materials may be considered ONLY after the BV Building Manager (Rob) has approved them, and she has a final right of veto.)

DO NOT attempt to cut any material that contains/emits hazardous vapours.

=== Supported file formats ===
The laser is driven by Corel Draw, so anything it can import will work fine. The laser will cut any shape that has a "hairline" border line, and will engrave anything else in the image.

See below for the Epilog driver that other programs can use. Note it's only compatible with Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 (32-bit mode only).

=== Obtaining Materials ===

Some suppliers of materials you can cut with the laser (not to say that everything they sell is suitable, merely that some things are! ALWAYS CHECK!):
  * [[http://avonply.co.uk]] based in Pixash Lane Keynsham. Sell 3 / 4 / 6mm birch ply (and other sheet materials). Sheets are roughly 1500x1500mm but they will cut them into smaller pieces for a nominal charge.       Delivery or collection.
  * [[http://hpclaser.co.uk]]
  * [[http://www.hindleys.com]]
  * [[http://www.mindsetsonline.co.uk/ | Mindsets Online ]] sell some laserable boards including [[http://www.mindsetsonline.co.uk/Catalogue/ProductDetail/birch-ply-4mm-laserable-?productID=4b0b994c-38ea-45d9-af81-9a135c48d962&catalogueLevelItemID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 | birch ply ]]
