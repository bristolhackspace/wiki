The Members' Meetings are an informal chance for all members to get involved and have their say about the running of the Hackspace. 

The meetings are usually well attended and have a very positive effect on the running of the space. Items to be discussed can be added by anyone and are circulated in advance. Minutes are published almost immediately afterwards on the wiki.
