As anyone who has been within earshot of me lately has probably noticed, I've moved house.

And it's perhaps no coincidence that this has happened around the time that the Raspberry Pi has finally come on sale.

And the third leg of this unholy tripod is that I've built my own backup/archival system based on content-address storage, which I am building a "replicated backend" for, meaning that it can spread my backups over a pool of storage servers, with replication and distribution of data.

So the plan is this: I want to build a few nodes, dotted around my house. Each node will contain a Raspberry Pi, an external USB hard disk, and a small amp and speakers, all hooked up to the house Ethernet.

This will provide a physically distributed backup system (at least one of them will be in an outbuilding), as well as a system that can stream music to the rooms in the house. But I want a little more than most music streaming daemons... I'd also like each node to have the ability to fade the music down, pause it, text-to-speech a message, then fade the music back.

Because we don't currently have a doorbell, and my wife's studio in the attic is somewhat out of earshot of the front door, not to mention my workshop at the far end of the garden...

This is a low-priority project, but one I'll slowly progress as I get time.
