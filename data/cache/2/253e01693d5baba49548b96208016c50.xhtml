The messy room (G10) contains a metal vice and a wood vice that belong to the Hackspace.

The metal vice is roughly in the middle of the room, attached to a metal bench, with a Hackspace equipment label on it. The wooden vice is on the bench just to the right as you turn into the door.

It can be a good idea to protect the surface of the item you are clamping with some scrap pieces of wood, too, or the vice jaws will scratch things.
