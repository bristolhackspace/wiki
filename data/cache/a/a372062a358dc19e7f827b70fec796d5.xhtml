BV Studios Open Day 2013 will be over the weekend Fri 14-Sun 16 June (Friday evening and all day Saturday and Sunday). It would be nice to show off a few projects, such as the ones discussed at the <a href="/dwiki/doku.php?id=botlab:openmeeting_20130603" class="wikilink1" title="botlab:openmeeting_20130603"> open meeting on 3 June</a>.

If you&#039;re intending to bring a project, please could you add it to this list:

<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Sketchy should be there, though I won&#039;t be about to run it all weekend.</div>
</li>
</ul>
