Matt V has bought a CNC router (made by routoutuk). It has a bed size of 50cm2 with a Z axis travel of 8cm. It lives in G10 (across the corridor from our main space). He&#039;s happy to give <a href="/dwiki/doku.php?id=cnc_router_training" class="wikilink2" title="cnc_router_training" rel="nofollow">CNC router training</a> training and make it available for trained hackspace members.
