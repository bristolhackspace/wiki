In September 2013 we purchased a year&#039;s membership to the <a href="http://www.childrensscrapstore.co.uk/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.childrensscrapstore.co.uk/"  rel="nofollow"> Children&#039;s Scrapstore</a> (expires 17 September 2014). 
</p>

<p>
To use the Scrapstore you need to take a membership card. We have 4 cards, in the filing cabinet against the wall by the glass door, on the right hand side if you are inside the space facing the door. They&#039;re in the drawer labelled “paperwork” (the 3rd drawer down). The cards are numbered - if you borrow one, please could you sign it out (and in) on the paper signing-out sheet in the drawer with them.
