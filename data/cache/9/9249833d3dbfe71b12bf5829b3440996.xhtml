Dear participant,
</p>

<p>
thanks again for joining us!
</p>

<p>
To help us get started quickly, please install the arduino IDE on your computer (<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage" class="urlextern" title="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage"  rel="nofollow">http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage</a>)
</p>

<p>
We start at 10am on Saturday.
</p>

If you have any problems getting in or finding us, please call Matt on xxxxxx
</p>

<p>
There are bike racks outside and bus stops near by. If you come by car then there are some local car parks: Millenium Car Park. the NCP and the Trenchard Street multistorey is not too long a walk, and is cheaper.
</p>

<p>
You can bring lunch with you, or there are local places to eat in or take out.
</p>

<p>
You may find it useful to have an old-fashioned notebook and pen with you to jot down notes for your own reference.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we want to spend Sunday helping you to build your own projects; so have a think about what you might like to do. Lots of inspiration here:
