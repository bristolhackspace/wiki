Ginjaian is 3D-printing parts for a small lathe. Alaric&#039;s offered to pay him for plastic to finish it off so he can build it as it looks fun. This has started to grow into a group project to have a small lathe in the space.

Matthew Venn has a Proper Metal Lathe that can be borrowed for a small fee, but there&#039;s still a benefit to this little one:

<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> It&#039;ll be fine for simple tasks.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If we break it, we can print new parts (let&#039;s be honest, it&#039;s the plastic bits that will break) rather than having a huge repair bill.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> It&#039;ll be owned by the group so we can extend it crazily until it&#039;s CNC controlled, sentient, and able to reproduce itself.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> It&#039;ll be fun.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Ginjaian for use of his 3D printer and his time and maybe some other bits (was a threaded rod or two mentioned?)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Alaric has pledged Â£30 for the plastic, and some time to put it together and play with it, and will obtain some parts as required.</div>
