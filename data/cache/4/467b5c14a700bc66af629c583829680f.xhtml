Nic Marshall has very kindly offered us the use of his HP DesignJet 500 large-format printer (model number C7769B), currently in G11. We have agreed to make a contribution to running costs (paper and ink), but Hackspace members are welcome to make use of it.

It has a straightforward USB connection at the back on the left hand side.
