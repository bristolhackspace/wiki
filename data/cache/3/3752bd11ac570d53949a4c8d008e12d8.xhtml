Previous wisdom suggests that one such as <a href="http://www.brunelmicroscopessecure.co.uk/acatalog/Brunel_Microscopes_DM_Low_Power_hand_lenses_28.html#a772" class="urlextern" title="http://www.brunelmicroscopessecure.co.uk/acatalog/Brunel_Microscopes_DM_Low_Power_hand_lenses_28.html#a772"  rel="nofollow">http://www.brunelmicroscopessecure.co.uk/acatalog/Brunel_Microscopes_DM_Low_Power_hand_lenses_28.html#a772</a> at £62+VAT would suffice.

The DM6 is cheaper and was the one Richard suggested. The total including shipping for the DM6 is £48.96.
</p>

<p>
We&#039;ve overbid (£90) so if nobody objects Alaric will buy the DM6 if everyone who bids gives him 54% of what they bid - £10.80 for the £20 folks and £5.40 for the £10 folks, and the few pence change goes into the hackspace moneybox. If anyone objects, respond on the mailing list soon!

Alaric has ordered the scope. It&#039;s in the hackspace, and claimed as an expense, so please send your pledges to David.
